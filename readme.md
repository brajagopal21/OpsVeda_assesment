# When I add a new activity, it should appear in Red font and gradually fade to black font in 15 seconds.-->done

# The activity I tick 3rd last (to indicate completion) should appear in Yellow font, the task ticked 2nd last should appear in Magenta font and the last task ticked should appear in Green.  All other ticked tasks should have the current grey color. Ofcourse as I tick more tasks as complete, the colors of the prior 3 completed tasks will change.-->have some issue 

# Add a couple of columns - the first one shows the time when the activity was added and the second one shows the time when the activity was completed. Of course the second column will be empty if the activity is not yet ticked as complete.-->functionality done
